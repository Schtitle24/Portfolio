        Howdy! It is a pleasure to meet you! My name is Winston and I am an aspiring junior developer! I am soon to graduate from University of Texas' tech bootcamp on the MERN stack and excited to get out into the world to solve problems. I am currently working on a passion project concerning the Meow Wolf exhibits (unsponsored of course) and can't wait for it to get done so I can add it here to show you! In the meantime feel free to poke around some of the applications I was able to create in my time in the bootcamp.
